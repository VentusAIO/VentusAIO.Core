IMPORTANT INFO ABOUT PROXIES
To work with proxies properly you need to set system properties via one of the following methods:

1) In your jre settings: Java\jre1.8.0_131\lib\net.properties (this path is an example) in this file you should comment
    following line: jdk.http.auth.tunneling.disabledSchemes=Basic
    (this method was not tested yet)
2) In main method of your application add following lines of code:
    System.setProperty("jdk.http.auth.tunneling.disabledSchemes", "");
    System.setProperty("jdk.http.auth.proxying.disabledSchemes", "");
    (works just fine)
3) Add runtime parameter (aka VM parameters, aka CLI arguments for java command):
    -Djdk.http.auth.tunneling.disabledSchemes=""
    -Djdk.http.auth.proxying.disabledSchemes=""
    (works just fine)
